## Introduction

Reactotron is a powerful debugger for React Native applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to monitor their application's state, network requests, and performance metrics and can be used for any size of project, from small personal apps to large-scale enterprise applications. It's the OG debugger at Infinite Red that we use on a day-to-day basis to build client apps. And, best of all, Reactotron is completely open source and free to use!
